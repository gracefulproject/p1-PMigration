# p1-PMigration
Experimental on process migration. Previously, we proposed to use MCPL for communication between pmagents and the supervisor. Now we use FR for communication.

There are two sub-projects:
PMigration.FR: for generating APLX programs
spinnaker_tools_pm: the modified tools needed to build PMigration.FR
